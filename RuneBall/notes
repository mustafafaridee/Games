# Minor performance tweaks - SMALL UPDATE

# The fireballs need to be returned to original speed and spawn delay
# The aiming system right now is unsatisfactory. The fireballs travel in the general direction of the mouse, but not precisely enough.
# Regular fireballs will be buffed and will now do 2 damage each, rather than 1.
# Tile spawn rate will be increased to 37.5% again but as for the difficulty factor, in the line 'min_health = max(1, int(0.75 * round_number))', the 0.75 will be changed to 0.6.
